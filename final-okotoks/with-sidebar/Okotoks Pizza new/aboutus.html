                There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’
                flavour,
                experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again, again,
                and
                again.
                We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not
                scouring
                the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re cra!ing perfect
                pizzas for you and
                your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge
                brownies,
                everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
                A!er watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Ma# Cleveland learned how to
                make
                people happy, one topping at a "me. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Ma# has managed to
                evolve
                the
                fresh, tradi"onal Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and
                convenient
                comfort food for today’s family on the go.
                Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes,
                made-from-scratch
                sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a
                healthy
                Flax
                crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about ea"ng it. And you feel even be#er knowing
                we're
                always
                ready to make you more
